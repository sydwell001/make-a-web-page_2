    <div class="lesson"><h2> Lesson 1: Basic of  the web and HTML</h2>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Introduction to the web</h3>

        - <b>World Wide Web:</b> is a collection of HTML documents.<br>

        - <b>HTML</b> stands for: Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>

        -<b>Webpag links:</b> Different webpages are linked or glued together using hyperlinks e.g <a href="www.webpagelink.com">click me.</a>Will take you to www.webpagelink.com
      </div>

      <div><h3>Major Pieces of the Web</h3>

        There are four main components of the world wide web as follow:<br>

        1. <b>User:</b>This is you, sitting on a computer right now.<br>

        2. <b> Computer:</b> This is the machine you will use that would be having a browser (<em>e.g</em> Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari etc.).<br>

        3. <b>Internet:</b> This is the actual structure that will direct the request path to the actual destination.<br>

        4. <b>Server:</b> This is a computer known as server that only serve information requested by the user.<br><br>

        <em><b>Note:</b></em> a protocol known as http (hyper text tranfer protocol) is used to communicate from the user's computer via web browser through the internet path to the Server'.The server communicate back with requested information.<br>

        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>

        - Tags are also used to instruct the computer to do <em><b>markups, links,</b></em>etc.<br>

        - Tags are also used to make links to <em><b>images, webpages</b></em>etc.<p>Looking Forward to Learn more on <b>Udacity!!</b></p>

    <div class="lesson"><h2>Lesson 2 Summary</h2>

      <div><h3>Creating a structured documents with HTML</h3>

        1. <b>Tree Structure:</b> Web browser is using a tree structure to determine how to display pages.<br>

        2. <b>Document Object Model:</b> Is a process were a browser take all the tags in html and create elements in a dom to form a tree like structure.<br>

        3. <b>Boximizing Process:</b> After the dom is formed, everything on the webpage tend to be in boxes or boxes inside boxes and its box has its own class name. The tag name div is used to define a  box.

        <p>	<em><b>Note:</b></em> Boxing makes it easy to manipulate or deal with different images, text, multimedia. The more the boxes the more the webpage get crouded. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><h3>Developer Tools</h3>

        There are 3 developer tools that we covered to write HTML documents:
        <p>
        	1. <b>Scratchpad:</b>This gives a real time feedback of how your webpage will look; can be used for simple webpages.<br>
        	2. <b>Codepen:</b> This takes 2-3 seconds to give feedback of how your page will look like.<br>
        	3. <b>Sublime:</b> This need one to refresh the page, but it is a more professional tool for web developers.<br><br>
        	<b><em>Note:</em></b>All these developer tools can do the same thing, write HTML code, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
        </p>

    <div class="lesson"><h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS style and HTML</h2>
        <h3>Adding CSS Style and HTML</h3>
          1. In sublime we can have html code and we can also have CSS styles. These can be on the same page splited into 2 layouts.<br>
          2. To link html code with css code we need to add a line of html code in the head section as:<br><br> <div class="skeleton"><img src="images/gif/link.gif" alt="image not found"></div>.<br>
          3. Every webpage you see on the internet, has the following skeleton and the rest is meat:<br><br>
          <div class="skeleton"><img src="images/gif/html_skeleton.gif" alt="html skeleton not found">
           <br>
            <em>figure 1: html skeleton structure</em>
         </div>.<br>
          4. You can add css style in html using the style tag instead of link tag.<br>
          5. Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor descendant relationship to operate.<br>
          6. Descendent elements inherit text-related properties, but box related properties are not.<br>
        
        <h3>Stylingup with CSS</h3>
          1. In CSS you first write a selector.<br>
          2. A selector defines what element of the page a particular style will apply to.<br>
          <em><b>Note:</b></em> Selecting a html tag in CSS means CSS rules will apply to all those html tags on the page.<br>
           3. Two ways to select html tags:<br>
          - Select tags straight to allow css rules to apply to all similar tags on the page.<br>
          - Select a class name to all css rules to apply to that particular class.
        <h3>Using CSS to Avoid Repetition</h3>
           	CSS meaning Cascading Style Sheet can be used to avoid code repetition of similar nature.<br>
        	1. Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, which is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element but also to its descendents.<br>
       		2. Descendent element inherit text-related properties, but box related properties are not inherited.<br><br>
         		<u class="skeleton">Example: Inherited and Unherited properties</u>
         	<table class="table_shift">
         		<tr>
         			<th>Inherited Properties:</th>
         			<td>Color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text transform, visibility, white-space and words-spacing.</td>
         		</tr>
         		<tr>
         			<th>Uninherited Properties:</th>
         			<td>Background, border, displays, height and width, margin, min and max, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration and vertical align.</td>
         		</tr>
         	</table>
      	<h3>Exploring HTML and CSS</h3>
      	  	1. Comments in HTML is as follow: <img src="images/gif/comment.gif" alt="image not found">.<br>
       		 2. Comments in CSS is as follow: /*Text*/.<br>
       		 3. Headings in html we call them h1, h2, h3 etc. <br>
       		 4. Search engines uses these headings to index the structure and content of a webpage.<br>
    
      
        <h3>The Box Model</h3>
        <div> 
            Everything on a webpage is displayed in a box and each box consist of 4 layers as follow:<br>
            1. <b><em>Content:</em></b> What is displayed on a webpage.<br>
            2. <b><em>Padding:</em></b> Protect content by opening space around content.<br>
            3. <b><em>Border:</em></b> Barricade content and Padding.<br>
            4. <b><em>Margin:</em></b> Clears area around the border.<br><br>
            <div class="skeleton"><img src="images/gif/box_model.gif" alt="image not found"><br> Figure2: The box model overview</div><br>
            5. <b><em>Flex box:</em></b> Is an attribute that is used in CSS to have a box that auto flex.<br>
            6. <b><em>Box sizing:</em></b>You can size the box by pixels or by percentage. The other way to size the box is to use box-sizing attribute to border box.<br>
            7. <b><em>Box position:</em></b>Div elements are a block element and they take the entire width of a page. Adding the display:flex; rule in CSS will override this behavior and let div elements appear next to each other.
         </div>
        <h3>Adding Images</h3>
        <div> 
            1. To add images, you must first store images to a folder that can be accessed via web <b><em>e.g</em></b>Make a image folder   inside project folder.<br>
            2. Esure image name does not contain any spaces or accented characters.<br>
            3. Add images with the tag img:<img src="images/gif/adding_image.gif" alt="image not found">
         </div>
        <b><em>Note:</em></b> You can verify your html code and CSS code on the following link:<br>
        <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">html verification</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS verification</a>
